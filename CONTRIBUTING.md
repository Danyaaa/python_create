# How to contribute to Create
___

Thank you for considering contributing to Create!


### Support questions
---

All support questions can be created under the issue-tracker. 
Just mark your issue with the **question** label


### Reporting issues
---

Include the following information in your post:

- Describe what you expected to happen.
- If possible, include a `minimal reproducible example` to help
  identify the issue. This also helps check that the issue is not with
  your own code.
- Describe what actually happened. Include the full traceback if there
  was an exception.
- List your Python version and working environment.
  I.e `using python3.8.1 and macOS Catalina 10.15.6`


### Submitting patches
---

If there is not an open issue for what you want to submit, prefer
opening one for discussion before working on a PR. You can work on any
issue that doesn't have an open PR linked to it or a maintainer assigned
to it. These show up in the sidebar. No need to ask if you can work on
an issue that interests you!

[Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the repo,
